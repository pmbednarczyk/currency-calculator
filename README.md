# CURRENCY CONVERTER
I have decided to use Create React App module to focus more on preparing functionality and design than setting up webpack.

TODOs: 
- IMPROVE TESTS;
- ADD MORE FEATURES LIKE: swapping currencies, handling user currency pockets money limit;
- ADD SOME FANCY ANIMATIONS AND TRANSITIONS;
- CUSTOMIZE WEBPACK CONFIG (add path resolving, sass variables preload);
